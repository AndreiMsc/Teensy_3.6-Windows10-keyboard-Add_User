Disclaimer: I do not encourage the misusage of the application. Do not use this on other people's PCs because it would be illegal. The code was developed ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE and TO SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE of what you can do with Teensy ON YOUR OWN PC. I cannot be held responsible for your usage of the code.

V1.0

 This application is developed using Arduino (a language set on C/C++ functions) programming language and tested on the Teensy 3.6 microcontroller, on Windows 10, in the Arduino application (with the Teensy extensions), under "Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick" usb type. It may(most probably) work on other 'usb type' configurations which include 'Keyboard'. It may also work on other OSes.

 Its purpose is to add an user in a short time. It can be used with various purposes including security tests. After user-adding procces is finished, it leaves no traces of its actions(ex. it closes the windows it used).
 
 The built in LED is used only at the begining to signal the connection between Teensy 3.6 and the device running Windows 10. It will close after short time (privacy).
 
 This application is for educational purpose and it acts like an example of Teensy usage. I am the author of the code, but the libraries used do not belong to me.

NOTE:Future version will modify: running time, eventual bugs
