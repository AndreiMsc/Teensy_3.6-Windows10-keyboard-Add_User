# Teensy_3.6-Windows10-keyboard-Add_User
V1.0

 This application is developed and tested on the Teensy 3.6 microcontroller, on Windows 10, under "Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick" usb type. It may(most probably) work on other 'usb type' configurations which include 'Keyboard'. It also may work on other OSes.
 Its purpose is to add an user in a short time. It can be used with various purposes including security tests. After user-adding procces is finished, it leaves no traces of its actions(ex. it closes the windows it used).
 The built in LED is used only at the begining to signal the connection between Teensy 3.6 and the device running Windows 10. It will close after short time (privacy).
 This application is for educational purpose and it acts like an example of Teensy usage. I am the author of the code, but the libraries used do not belong to me.

NOTE:Future version will modify: running time, eventual bugs
